The motive of this project is to classify News Headlines in the Gujarati Language into Labels.

We perform NLP tasks like classification based on various classifiers that use different feature extraction techniques on Gujarati language.

Focus on full-text classification i.e. full news, huge documents, long-length texts etc. is more prominent as compared to the short length text. In our mini project, we have discussed the text classification process, classifiers, and numerous feature extraction methodologies in context of short texts.

In this project , we classified Gujarati news headlines into labels such as Entertainment, Technology and Business.
The results accuracy based on various classifiers can be concluded as:

Random forest             72.133637 %
KNN                       68.337130 %
GaussianNB                61.351557 %
Decision Tree             64.768413 %
Support vector machine    73.044799 %
Logistic Regression       73.044799 %
Linear SVC                81.397115 %
