****News Headlines Classification in Gujarati Language 🚀****

**Project Overview**
This project aims to classify news headlines in the Gujarati language into predefined labels. We perform Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using various classifiers and feature extraction techniques tailored for Gujarati text.

Unlike traditional full-text classification (which focuses on long documents), this project deals with short-text classification such as news headlines.

**Classification Categories**
Gujarati news headlines are classified into the following categories:

📺 Entertainment
💻 Technology
💰 Business
Machine Learning Models & Accuracy
We experimented with multiple classification models and obtained the following accuracy scores:

**Classifier	Accuracy (%)**
🌲 Random Forest	72.13
🤖 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	68.34
📊 Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GaussianNB)	61.35
🌳 Decision Tree	64.77
🏆 Support Vector Machine (SVM)	73.04
🔢 Logistic Regression	73.04
📏 Linear SVC	81.40
Key Highlights
✅ Applied NLP techniques for text classification
✅ Used different machine learning classifiers to compare performance
✅ Achieved highest accuracy with Linear SVC (81.40%)
✅ Focused on short-text classification rather than full-text

**How to Run the Project?**
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the classification script:
python classify_news.py

**Future Scope**
🔹 Improve accuracy using deep learning (LSTMs, Transformers)
🔹 Add more categories for classification
🔹 Expand dataset for better generalization
